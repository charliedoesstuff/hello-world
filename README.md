# hello-world
This is a repository for ideas and resources.
My name is Charlie Johnson and I run BionicPPC.com, a data-driven (read: neurotic) marketing consultancy for entrepreneurs.
I'm super excited to be learning web development via The Odin Project and I'm happy to finally be learning more about GitHub.
